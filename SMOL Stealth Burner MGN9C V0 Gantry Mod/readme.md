# MGN9C Carraige for SMOL Stealth Burner (V0 Gantry)

This is a carriage mod that allows use of the SMOL Stealth Burner System on a traditional V0 Gantry with top mounted MGN9C. Also includes moded Dragon Adaptor to account for screws on the carriage--this is also needed for his stock MGN7 carraige *(it's a bug/missing)*

Note Green: The holes on the dragon adapter are not for magnets, rather clerance for the BHCS used to tighten belts with makerbeam style M3 threaded bar (standard in Voron builds)

Note Red: Use supports for best printibility, otherwise it's easy to trim/make it work with minor post processing. Ideally this ould be avoided but as it stands this helps constrain/keep rigidty of the mount and decreasing the ability for it bend/twist at that axis.
